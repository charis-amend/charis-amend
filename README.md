### a quick intro ðŸš€  
I have extensive experience working in both SaaS, mobile apps and start-up environments. 
During my time as Product Owner for "Deutschrap Quiz," I led the development and launch of a mobile app. I gained valuable experience in the start-up landscape whilst being self-employed and working at IDAGIO GmbH and Bitfury Surround GmbH. I was involved in creating a SaaS tool for the blockchain music market, which required a deep understanding of the SaaS industry. Furthermore, my role as an Innovation Manager at Sony Music Entertainment, I was immersed in the start-up culture, working on several MVPs as a product manager for the organization's growth and development.
